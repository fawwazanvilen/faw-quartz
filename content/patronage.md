Here's some things that I think should be given more patronage. Note that this is heavily biased and reflects my taste in things.

- A brass band that plays military marches from around the world
- A scene that patrons scorewriters, ..., ???, that would result in an Indonesian Sousa

List of shoulds
- KPU should open fellowships to economists, game theorists, more researchers
- KPU should let daerahs experiment with voting mechanisms

Favorite Reforms for DPR
- Internal Fractie voting mechanism
